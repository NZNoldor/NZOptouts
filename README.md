# NZ Opt-outs

In August 2019, I posted a list of preventable NZ annoyances to [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/ckg1i9/list_of_optouts_for_a_bunch_of_useless_and/) providing links and details of places where you can opt out of. A kindly fellow redditor reformatted the post into a .md file for me, converting it into this document.

If you know any additional opt-outs or corrections. please make a pull request.


## List of opt-outs for a bunch of useless and annoying NZ things

----
### Stop the physical spam in your mailbox
NZ's Marketing Association also has opt-outs - the "Do Not Mail" page, this one is supposed to cut down the physical spam in your mailbox (remember? the one outside the front door):

* [Marketing.co.nz Do Not Mail ](https://www.marketing.org.nz/Services/Do_Not_Mail)

If it continues to happen, they have an 0800 number you can call to report it (0800 111 081). Overall, it works pretty great - coupled with the "no circulars" sticker, we go through weeks of completely empty mailboxes. All of our bills come in electronically these days.

### Stop NZ Telemarketeers from calling you
The NZ Marketing Association also has a "Do Not Call" opt-out page. This one stops NZ telemarketers from calling you, say, during dinner. I've not had a call for years.

* [Marketing.co.nz Do Not Call](https://www.marketing.org.nz/Services/Do_Not_Call)

### Stop delivery of the useless Yellow Pages

With the internet at hand, the most useless publication these days is surely the Yellow Pages, which gets printed out for everyone and never used again in most cases. They too have an opt-out option, just click here:

* [Yellow pages: opt-out](https://ypgbooks.co.nz/opt-out/)

### Stop Cold-Callers from knocking on your door
Here's a good one - if you hate door-to-door salespeople as much as I do, get yourself a sticker from Consumer NZ. Simply click here to get one sent to your house. It's free if you're a paying member, or send a stamped self-addressed envelope to them if you're not a member. Alternatively, you can also get them from your local Citizen's Advice Bureau.

### Stop non-deliveries
A lot of delivery drivers have a habit of knocking once, then immediately driving off, leaving a "you weren't home when we called" card before you've even got out of your armchair. As long as you're happy for them to leave boxes on your doorstep (rather than chasing them for re-delivery), most courier services have a form you can fill out, allowing them to simply leave it no matter what. It does make you responsible for the security of it though, so beware of porch-pirates.

* [New Zealand Post & CourierPost: Parcel Leave Ongoing](https://www.nzpost.co.nz/personal/receiving-mail-parcels/receiving-your-parcels/parcel-leave)
* [Fastways: Authority to leave](https://www.fastway.co.nz/tools/authority-to-leave/)
* [NZ Couriers: Leave my Delivery](https://www.leavemydelivery.co.nz/)

### No more parking fines 
NZTA's drivers license and car registration database is available to anyone who wants access. However, they have an Opt-out option so they can't pass your information on to 3rd parties.

* [Transact.nzta.govt.nz: Revoke authorised access to my personal details (Opt-out)](https://transact.nzta.govt.nz/transactions/PersonalInfoAccess/entry.aspx)

One of the companies that has access to your information is Wilsons Parking, so after the opt-out, you can literally ignore any of their tickets, since they can no longer use your car's registration plate find your address in order to send you their parking fines. For more info, check here:

* [Reddit.com: How to defend a $65 Wilsons Parking Ticket](https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/77bz67/how_to_defend_a_65_wilsons_parking_ticket/)

NB - I'm not a lawyer, and if this tip offends your sensibilities, don't do it. If you do use it, and it doesn't work, don't come running to me. You're all grownsups, and perhaps you shouldn't have parked in a Wilson's Carpark if you didn't want the risk of a fine.

### Credits

>2017-2020: I created the initial list for myself because I hates spam in all its forms. Other opt-outs soon followed, and I made it more readable for other people. If it's useful to anyone out there, drop me a line!
