List of opt-outs for a bunch of useless and annoying NZ things


Over the years, I've opted out of a bunch of stuff that I've come across, and I've saved the links. Probably time I shared them. If anyone has any updates, corrections, or other good New Zealand opt-outs, please let me know via a PM.

=========== No more parking fines ===========

NZTA's drivers license and car registration database is available to anyone who wants access. However, they have an Opt-out option so they can't pass your information on to 3rd parties.

One of the companies that has access to your information is Wilsons Parking, so after the opt-out, you can literally ignore any of their tickets, since they can no longer use your car's registration plate find your address in order to send you their parking fines. For more info, check here:

=========== Stop the physical spam in your mailbox ===========

NZ's Marketing Association also has opt-outs - the "Do Not Mail" page, this one is supposed to cut down the physical spam in your mailbox (remember? the one outside the front door):

If it continues to happen, they have an 0800 number you can call to report it (0800 111 081). Overall, it works pretty great - coupled with the "no circulars" sticker, we go through weeks of completely empty mailboxes. All of our bills come in electronically these days.

=========== Stop NZ Telemarketeers from calling you ===========

The NZ Marketing Association also has a "Do Not Call" opt-out page. This one stops NZ telemarketers from calling you, say, during dinner. I've not had a call for years.

=========== Stop delivery of the useless Yellow Pages ===========

With the internet at hand, the most useless publication these days is surely the Yellow Pages, which gets printed out for everyone and never used again in most cases. They too have an opt-out option, just click here:

=========== Stop Cold-Callers from knocking on your door ===========

Here's a good one - if you hate door-to-door salespeople as much as I do, get yourself a sticker from Consumer NZ. Simply click here to get one sent to your house. It's free if you're a paying member, or send a stamped self-addressed envelope to them if you're not a member. Alternatively, you can also get them from your local Citizen's Advice Bureau.

=========== Stop non-deliveries ===========

A lot of delivery drivers have a habit of knocking once, then immediately driving off, leaving a "you weren't home when we called" card before you've even got out of your armchair. As long as you're happy for them to leave boxes on your doorstep (rather than chasing them for re-delivery), most courier services have a form you can fill out, allowing them to simply leave it no matter what. It does make you responsible for the security of it though, so beware of porch-pirates.
